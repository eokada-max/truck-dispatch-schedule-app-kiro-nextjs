4. IF User releases the Schedule Card over an invalid location, THEN THE System SHALL return the card to its original position
5. WHEN a schedule is successfully moved, THE System SHALL save the changes to the database and display a success message

### Requirement 2: 時間範囲選択による新規スケジュール作成

**User Story:** As a User, I want to select a time range on the timeline by dragging, so that I can quickly create new schedules with pre-filled time information

5. IF User clicks without dragging, THEN THE System SHALL not trigger the selection mode

### Requirement 3: スケジュールのリサイズ

**User Story:** As a User, I want to resize schedules by dragging their edges, so that I can adjust delivery time durations quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN User hovers over the top or bottom edge of a Schedule Card, THE System SHALL display a resize cursor
2. WHEN User drags the top edge, THE System SHALL adjust the start time while keeping the end time fixed
3. WHEN User drags the bottom edge, THE System SHALL adjust the end time while keeping the start time fixed
4. THE System SHALL snap resize operations to 15-minute intervals
5. WHEN resize is complete, THE System SHALL save the updated times to the database

### Requirement 4: 視覚的フィードバック

**User Story:** As a User, I want clear visual feedback during drag operations, so that I understand what will happen when I release

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHILE dragging a Schedule Card, THE System SHALL display the card with reduced opacity
2. THE System SHALL show a drop target indicator at the cursor position
3. WHEN hovering over a valid drop location, THE System SHALL highlight the target time slot

5. THE System SHALL display the new time information during drag operations

### Requirement 5: 競合検出と警告

**User Story:** As a User, I want to be warned about scheduling conflicts, so that I can avoid double-booking drivers or time slots

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN User attempts to move a schedule to a time that overlaps with another schedule for the same driver, THE System SHALL display a warning message
2. THE System SHALL allow the user to proceed with the conflicting schedule after confirmation
3. WHEN a conflict is detected, THE System SHALL highlight the conflicting schedules
4. THE System SHALL check for conflicts in real-time during drag operations
5. THE System SHALL provide an option to automatically find the next available time slot

### Requirement 6: モバイル対応

**User Story:** As a User, I want to use drag and drop features on mobile devices, so that I can manage schedules on the go

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL support touch events for drag and drop operations on mobile devices
2. WHEN User long-presses a Schedule Card on mobile, THE System SHALL enable drag mode
3. THE System SHALL provide touch-friendly resize handles on mobile devices

5. THE System SHALL provide haptic feedback on supported mobile devices

### Requirement 7: 操作の取り消し

**User Story:** As a User, I want to undo drag and drop operations, so that I can recover from mistakes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN User presses Escape during a drag operation, THE System SHALL cancel the operation and return the schedule to its original position

2. THE System SHALL debounce database updates during drag operations
3. THE System SHALL use optimistic UI updates to provide immediate feedback
4. THE System SHALL limit the number of DOM manipulations during drag operations
5. WHEN dragging over multiple time slots, THE System SHALL throttle position calculations to every 50 milliseconds

### Requirement 9: アクセシビリティ

**User Story:** As a User with accessibility needs, I want to move schedules using keyboard shortcuts, so that I can use the system without a mouse

#### Acceptance Criteria
